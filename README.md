# arduinotest

## Why

I spent two weeks trying to do a thing with an Arduino Uno R3. It never worked. Eventually I suspected that just maybe it could not work because I had lost hardware function of one or more digitial IO ports. I wrote a test program to see if that was the case. This project is the result.

## Scope of work

1. Digital Outputs test. Wire all the outputs to an LED with a current limitin resistor. 330 ohms should do it.

2. To Do: Digital inputs test

3. To Do: every other test one might come up with.
